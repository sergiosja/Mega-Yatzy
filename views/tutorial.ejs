            <h3> Roll die </h3>
            <p>
                To start a new game of Mega Yatzy, roll the die by clicking the "roll"-button.
                To simulate a realistic dieroll, the die will be assigned a random value from 1 to 6,
                and in some cases they will remain the same. You have a max amount of rolls each round,
                so use them carefully. If you don't use all your rolls in one round, they will be
                transferred to the next one.

            <h3> Lock die </h3>
            <p>
                If you are satisfied with the values of certain die, you can click the die in question,
                and if their background changes, their value will stay the same even when you click the
                "roll"-button again. To unlock them, simply click them again.

            <h3> Choosing a value </h3>
            <p>
                If your die values include a pair, you can click the "Pairs" section and the pair options
                will be revealed. Then you can click "One pair". The option background will change, the
                die will be reset, the pair value will be added to the total pot, and (if you're not on
                mobile) you will be redirectedvback to the top to roll the die again.

            <p>
                When you complete all options of a category, the category background will change and it
                will become unclickable, to make it easier for the player to know what is done.

            <h2> Score options </h2>
            <p>
                Each main category has sub-categories, and each sub-category adds a value to the total
                sum.
            </p>

            <h3> Ones through Sixes </h3>
            <p>
                These add the respective sum of all die showing the value 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
            </p>
            <img src="/Images/first.png">


            <h3> Pairs </h3>
            <p>
                These add the respective sum of die showing one, two and three pairs.
            </p>
            <img src="/Images/second.png">


            <h3> Kinds </h3>
            <p>
                These add the respective sum of die showing three, four and five kinds of the same value.
            </p>
            <img src="/Images/third.png">


            <h3> Straights </h3>
            <p>
                Small straight adds 15 points if your die include 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
                Big straight adds 20 points if your die include 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
                Full straight adds 21 points if your die include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
                The combinations do not need to be ordered, and die showing [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                and [5, 3, 1, 4, 2] are equally worth 15 points.
            </p>
            <img src="/Images/fourth.png">


            <h3> Settlements </h3>
            <p>
                Cottage adds the sum of a "one pair" and a "three of a kind".
                Villa adds the sum of two "three of a kind"s.
                Tower adds the sum of a "one pair" and a "four of a kind".

                It goes without saying that the combination values have to be different. The highest
                attainable value for a villa is 33 (6x3 + 5x3) rather than 36 (6x6).
            </p>

            <h3> Chance, Yatzy, and Straight Flush </h3>
            <p>
                Chance adds the sum of all die, a useful option if you cannot fulfill any other option.
                Yatzy adds the sum of all die if they are similar, and throws a 100 point bonus on top of that.
                Straight Flush is an ordered "big straight" (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). It gives a fixed 150 points.
